<h2 align="center">🔧 Data Process & Workflow</h2>


### 1. Data Preparation & ETL (Power Query)
- Imported real-world data on data-related job postings (titles, skills, salaries, regions, platforms, etc.)
- Cleaned and standardized columns to correct data types, handle blanks/nulls, and unify naming formats
- Created multiple **supporting dimension tables** using Power Query:
  - **Skill Table** for analyzing frequency of required skills
  - **Schedule Type Table** (e.g., Full Time, Internship, Contractor, etc.)
  - **Date Table** to support time intelligence (YTD trends, filters)
- Used **custom columns** and **conditional columns** to derive meaningful categories

### 2. Data Modeling (Power BI Data View)
- Designed a **star schema** with relationships between:
  - A central **Fact Table** (job postings)
  - Dimension tables (skills, dates, schedule type, platforms, companies)
- Enforced referential integrity and optimized one-to-many relationships

### 3. DAX & Measures
- Created a centralized **Measures Table** to maintain all calculated metrics
- Built advanced DAX measures for:
  - `Median Yearly Salary`, `Hourly Salary`, `Job Count`, `Skills per Job`
  - Percentage calculations: `% of Jobs`
- Used **CALCULATE**, **FILTER**, and **ALLSELECTED** to enable dynamic interactions in visuals

### 4. Parameterization
- Created **field parameters** and **numeric range parameters** to allow users to:
  - Toggle between salary metrics
  - Compare job count vs skill count
